(d) “User” or “You” or “Your” refers to a natural person who has accepted this Agreement in order to download and use the App.

2. Any reference to the singular includes a reference to the plural and vice versa, and any reference to one gender includes a reference to other gender(s), unless explicitly provided for.

(b) accessing or using the App or any of the content available within the App from any device.

C. PROVISION OF THE APP

1. The App is designed to provide You an in-app browsing experience through an embedded browser. The App does not per se provide any news or content or information; but provides a brief summary of the content available in public domain within 60 (sixty) words or through the App.

2. The App may include links to other mobile applications and/or websites (some of which may be automated search results) which may contain materials that are objectionable, unlawful, or inaccurate. We do not endorse or support these links or the products and services they provide; these links are provided for Your convenience only. We are not responsible or liable for the content or accuracy of such links.

3. In order to provide the App to You, We may request You to register and/or provide information about yourself. We trust that any information provided by You will always be true, accurate, complete and updated.

3. We may choose to not act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by You or others but this does not mean that We cannot act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. Our intended or intended failure to exercise or enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
